## Description
In the cryptocurrency ecosystem, every transaction requires fees to be validated by the network. These fees vary based on network congestion and desired urgency. This application simulates a crypto wallet with a mempool, helping users understand and optimize their transaction fees for Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Key features include:
- Creating Bitcoin or Ethereum wallets.
- Creating transactions with different fee priorities (Economique, Standard, Rapide).
- Simulating a mempool where transactions are prioritized by fees.
- Calculating a transaction's position in the mempool and estimating confirmation time.
- Comparing the cost and speed trade-offs of different fee levels.
- Viewing the current state of the mempool.

## Technologies Used
- **Java 8**: The core programming language.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for persistent storage of wallets and transactions.
- **JDBC**: Java Database Connectivity for interacting with PostgreSQL.
- **java.util.logging**: For application logging.
- **Java Time API**: For date and time management.
